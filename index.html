        <h2>Hello There!</h2>
        <p>I'm Michael Shakarian, from Hicksville, NY. Thanks for stopping by my Software Engineering portfolio!</p>
        <p>I'm currently learning from <a href="http://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> to build a skillset that can add value both personally and professionally. I'll be adding to this page as I learn more, so keep coming back to see my progress!</p>

          <ul>
            <li>tips,</li>
            <li>tricks,</li>
            <li>or criticisms (be gentle!)</li>

        <h2>About Michael</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was a young boy I was interested in tech, video games, and the internet. I remember building hobby websites using nothing more than Notepad and some shoddily cobbled HTML code uploaded to <strong>Angelfire</strong> and <strong>Geocities</strong>. This was back before Facebook or even MySpace, where regular people first experienced creating a "Web Presence". I haven't bought a pre-built computer in over 20 years as I prefer to build them myself. That way, I can pick each part individually and I also enjoy the process.</p>
        <p>I'm a proud nerd and an enormous <i>Star Wars</i> fan, to the point that I taught myself small electronics soldering so that I could build my own replica lightsabers out of parts. I've gutted cheap, name-brand toy lightsabers just to harvest the soundboard from them to put into something a bit more powerful.</p>
